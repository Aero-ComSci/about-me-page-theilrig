                    A single sentence can change your path in life, and for me this was it. Ever since that Hello World I haven’t looked away from programming. I’ve been taking every step from the simplest of python to syntax to complex data structures, and the best part about programming is that the journey never ends. There is no end goal, or summit where you’re done learning, and for that alone I’ll continue taking steps everyday for my programming journey whether its self learning or in a career.

                    However I can’t build skills without first building up myself. Over the years focusing on whatever life threw at me, I’ve developed myself to find what I enjoy and commit. Even to the point of a “healthy” obsession. Whenever I truly believe in something or take initiative to be the  benefactor of the group. My drive to complete the task is only matched by my curiosity, I just have to look into all the edge cases and deviations. I’ve developed these skills to further myself and drive my own learning, and they dont go without utilization

                    I’ve managed to win my graduate class award for history due to my insatiable interest in the subject. In addition to this I’ve completed  self driven CS 50 for python. In addition to this I have been in private division 2 fencing, with the same tenacity towards all of my passions. Lastly, I’ve maintained over 1200 chess.com elo for over a year.

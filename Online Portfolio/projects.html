                        Objective was to create a project of our design. The final product ended up becoming a news
                        site. This site has 2 main tags linking to articles by other sources including the BBC and NYC
                        Times on conflicts in Israel and Venezuela. In addition it features the “Awoke” branding and has
                        its own introductory paragraph. Documentation wise it was made with HTML, CSS and additional
                        design elements from Canva.

                        Objective was to create a product capable of solving problems. The problem in question was
                        helping with youth dyslexia and preparing them for the future. The solution was to create a
                        touch typing game similar to other software products. It would go letter by letter until the
                        entirety of Dr.Seuss’s The Cat in the Hat was completed. And has an on screen timer system
                        tracking time left and how many chances remain for the player. All developed in pygame.
